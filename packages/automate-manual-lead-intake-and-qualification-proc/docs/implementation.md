# Implementation Guide: Automate Manual lead intake and qualification process

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Automate Manual lead intake and qualification process automation solution.

**Automation Type**: Lead Management Automation
**Complexity**: Low
**Estimated Timeline**: 1-3 weeks

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Required integrations: CRM System (HubSpot/Salesforce)
- Administrative access to target systems

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure n8n is running and accessible
2. Verify API access to required systems
3. Prepare test data for validation

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Environment Preparation

1. **Access n8n Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your n8n instance
   - Ensure you have editor permissions

2. **Configure Credentials**
   - Set up credentials for each integration:
      - CRM System (HubSpot/Salesforce): Add API credentials in n8n credentials panel

3. **Import Workflow**
   - Import the provided workflow JSON file: `automate_manual_lead_intake_and_qualification_process_automation.json`
   - Review all nodes and connections

### Phase 2: Configuration

1. **Update Workflow Settings**
   - Modify workflow name if needed
   - Adjust trigger settings based on your requirements
   - Configure webhook URLs (if applicable)

2. **Test Individual Nodes**
   - Execute each node individually to verify configuration
   - Check data transformation steps
   - Validate API connections

### Phase 3: Testing

1. **Execute Test Run**
   - Use provided test fixtures
   - Monitor execution logs
   - Verify expected outputs

2. **Validation Checklist**
      - [ ] Review and resolve validation issues

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Activate Workflow**
   - Enable the workflow in n8n
   - Set up monitoring and alerts

2. **Monitor Initial Runs**
   - Watch for errors or unexpected behavior
   - Validate data accuracy
   - Confirm automation objectives are met

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify API credentials are current
   - Check permission scopes
   - Regenerate tokens if necessary

2. **Data Format Issues**
   - Review data transformation nodes
   - Validate input data structure
   - Check field mappings

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement delays between API calls
   - Use exponential backoff for retries
   - Monitor API usage quotas
